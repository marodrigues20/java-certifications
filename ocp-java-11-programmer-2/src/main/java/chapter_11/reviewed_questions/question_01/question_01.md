1. How many requests does it take to have a DDoS attack?

A. None
B. One
C. Two 
D. Many

Answer: D

- A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack requires multiple requests by definition.
- Even a regular denial of service attack often requires multiple requests.
- For example, if you forget to close resources, it will take a number of tries for your application to run out resources.
- Therefore, option D is correct.
