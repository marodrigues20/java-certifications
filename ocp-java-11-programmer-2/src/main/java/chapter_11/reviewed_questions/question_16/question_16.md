16. What should your code do when input validation fails? (Choose all that apply.)


A. Call *System.exit()* immediately. <br>
B. Continue execution <br>
C. Log a message <br>
D. Throw an exception <br>
E. None of the above <br>

Answer: C, D


- The application should log a message or throw an exception, making option C and D correct.
- It should not immediately terminate the program with *System.exit()* as that not execute gracefully, making option A
  incorrect. It also should not ignore the issue, making option B incorrect.
