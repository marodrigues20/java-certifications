11. Which of the following are considered inclusion attacks? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Billion laughs attack.
B. Command injection
C. CSRF
D. SQL injection
E. XSS
F. Zip bomb

Answer: A, F.

- An inclusion attack needs to include something.
- Option A and F are correct because they are used with XML and ZIP file respectively.
- Option B and D are incorrect because injection is not an inclusion attack.
- Option C and E are not inclusion attacks either.
- In fact, you might not have heard of them. Both are attacks used against web applications.
- Don't worry if you see something on the exam that you haven't heard of; it isn't a correct answer.
