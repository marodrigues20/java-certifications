   (Choose all that apply)
Possible answer:

A. Apple
B. Orange
C. Banana
D. Pear
E. Tomato

Correct Answer is: B; E; 

- An exception that must be handled or declared is a checked exception.
- A checked exception inherits Exception but not RuntimeException.
- The entire hierarchy counts, so option B and E are both correct.
