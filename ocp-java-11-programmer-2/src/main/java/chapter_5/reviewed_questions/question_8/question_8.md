8. Which of the following prints OhNo with the assertion failure when the number
   magic is positive? (Choose all that apply)

Answer correct is A and D

A = assert magic < 0: "OhNo"
D = assert(magic <0): "OhNo"

- An assertion consist of a boolean expression followed by an optional colon (:) and message.
- The boolean expression is allowed to be in parentheses, but this is not required.
- Therefore, options A and D are correct.
