15. Which of the following are not *java.io* classes? (Choose all that apply.)

A. BufferedReader
B. BufferedWriter
C. FileReader
D. FileWriter
E. PrintReader
F. PrintWriter

Correct Answer: E


- *PrintStream* and *PrintWriter* are the only I/O classes that you need to know that don't have a complementary
  *InputStream* or *Reader* class, so option E is correct.
