B. Consumer and service provider interface <br>
C. Service Locator and service provider  <br>
D. Service locator and service provider interface <br>
E. Service provider and service provider interface <br>




Explanation.

Correct Answer: D

A service consists of the service provider interface and logic to look up implementations using a service locator.
This makes option D correct. Make sure you know that the service provider itself is the implementation, which is not 
considered part of the service.
