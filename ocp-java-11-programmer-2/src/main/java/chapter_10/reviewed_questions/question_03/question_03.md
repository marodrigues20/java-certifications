3. Which of the following is a valid JDBC URL?

A. jdbc:sybase:localhost:1234/db
B. jdbc::sybase::localhost::/db
C. jdbc::sybase:locahost::1234/db
D. sybase:localhost:1234/db
E. sybase::localhost::/db
F. sybase::localhost::1234/db

Answer: A


- A JDBC URL has three main parts separated by single colons, making options B, C, E, and F incorrect.
- The first part is always *jdbc*, making option D incorrect.
- Therefore, the correct answer is option A.
- Notice that you can get this right even if you've never heard of the Sybase database before.
