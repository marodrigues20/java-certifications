2. Which are required parts of a JDBC URL? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Connection parameter
B. IP address of database
C. jdbc
D. Password
E. Port
F. Vendor-specific string


Answer: C, F

- A JDBC URL has three parts. 
- The first part is the string *jdbc*, making option C correct.
- The second part is the subprotocol. This is the vendor/product name, which isn't an answer choice.
- The subname is vendor-specific , making option F correct as well.
