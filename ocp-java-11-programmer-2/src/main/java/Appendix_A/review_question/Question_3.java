/**
 * Which of the following are valid instance variable declarations?
 * (Choose all that apply.)
 *
 * Correct Answer: G
 *
 * None of these declarations is a valid instance variable declaration, as var
 * cannot be used with instance variables, only local variables. For this reason, option G is the only correct answer.
 * If the question were changed to be about local variable declarations, though, then the correct answer would be B, C,
 * D. An identifier must start with a letter, $, or _, so options E and F would be incorrect. Finally, null is a
 * reserved word but var is not, so option A would be incorrect.
