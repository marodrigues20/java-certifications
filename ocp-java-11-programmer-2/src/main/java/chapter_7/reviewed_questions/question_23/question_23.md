## What is the result of executing the following application? (Choose all that apply.)

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class StockRoomTracker {
    public static void await(CyclicBarrier cb) { // j1
        try { cb.await(); } catch (Exception e) { }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args{
        var cb = new CyclicBarrier(10,
            () -> System.out.println("Stock Room Full!")); // j2
        IntStream.iterate(1, i -> 1).limit(9).parallel()
            .forEach(i -> await(cb)); // j3
    } 
}
```

A. It outputs Stock Room Full!                      <br>
B. The code will not compile because of line j1.    <br>
C. The code will not compile because of line j2.    <br>
D. The code will not compile because of line j3.    <br>
E. It compiles but throws an exception at runtime.  <br>
F. It compiles but waits forever at runtime.        <br>

Correct Answer: F

- The code compiles without issue, so options B, C and D are incorrect.
- The limit on the cyclic barrier is 10, but the stream can generate only up to 9 threads that reach the barrier;
- Therefore, the limit can never be reached, and option F is the correct answer, making option A and E incorrect.
- Even if the *limit(9)* statement was changed to *limit(10)*, the program could still hang since the JVM might not 
  allocate 10 threads to the parallel stream.
